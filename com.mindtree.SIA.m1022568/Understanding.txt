This project is created through Maven.

In the src/test/java there are 4 packages.
	1) com.mindtree.SIA.HelloWorld
		This package has simple hello world project. Just to check framework is working fine.

	2) simpleProjectThroughChromePackage
		This is plain project having things hard coded.
		It has all xpath, site name, browser name hard coded.
		It has 4 test cases and written in single single java file.
		I created this package to understand usage of TestNG and its parameters.
			I understood @AfterTest, @Test, @BeforeTest
			I understood features like dependsOnMethods, priority, enabled

	3) projectThroughXMLValuesPickup
		This package includes two files.
		XMLForValuesFromXMLFileClass.xml and ValuesFromXMLFile.java
		xml file has two groups LogInTestCases and RegisterTestCases
		To understand how to run test cases in group I have disabled one group.
		How to pass values through XML I used few parameters.

		Which has following things.
			a) POM.xml
			b) 4 Test cases
				Sign-In
				Registration
				Flight Reservation
				Itinerary
			c) XmlFileToRunTestCases.xml
			d) It has src/main/java which has two packages

				datafiles   

	Will explain all of them one by one
	a) POM.xml
		I included dependency of org.testng, log4j, org.apache.poi for xlsx

	c) XmlFileToRunTestCases.xml To run the test cases in appropriate sequence.
		So, to run the suite. Run with this xml file.
	

	b, d ) For all the 4 test cases 
		I have used Log 4j logging methods.
		I have taken screenshots of each run and stored them under D:\Selenium\SeleniumInternalAssessment\Screenshots
		I have used Config.Properties where browser name, site name, username and password are stored.
		I have used dataProvider.xlsx which has all the values related to registration and flight booking
		I have used locator.csv file which has all the Xpaths configured.

		In the utilities package there are two files
		GenericFunctions which has all the default methods like clicking textbox, providing values, checkbox select, radio button select etc
		ExcelUtilities has the core logic to get the values from xlsx file.

		All the four classes are inheriting GenericFunctions class.
